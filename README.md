# Web Portfolio

Welcome to my web portfolio!

I wrote this page from scratch with HTML 5 and CSS 3, later with some SASS. I took inspiration from a bunch of other beautiful developer portfolios, prioritizing conciseness and brevity, getting straight to the point and showcasing my abilities.

I have many more project ideas that I want to try out, each one with a stack expanding more into fullstack applications, so I will keep this page updated, although I also plan to get it hosted somewhere else.
